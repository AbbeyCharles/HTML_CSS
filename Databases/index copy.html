                        <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating, manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or non-relational database. Relationships means a set of our data is related to another section of our data. Our databases are put into sections of data called schemas, inside each schema data set is organized into tables. Those tables contain columns and rows that house that particular set of data.</p>

                        <img src="images/database-search.jpg">
                        <p>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a database stores, one problem we might run into is finding the data we are looking for. Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Algorithim book. Well, you might start picking up each book, checking the title, and moving on to the next until ou found it. That's very slow, as most libraries discovered. If we were to assign an ID to each item, we could find it quickly.</p>

                        <p>The amazing part about having a database is that it is a storage bin that holds onto all saved data. Well, if only one user had asscee to that data, it's just like what we have built into our own computers: it wouldn't be useful to other users. However, the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating, and deleting information that all users would see.</p>
